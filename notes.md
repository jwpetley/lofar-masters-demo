# Demo for Masters Students

## STILTS

Use the example file. Explain why it could be useful.
All can be achieved in Python but STILTS matches 1to1 what TOPCAT is doing

## DS9

Open image. Demonstrate scaling for radio images. 

Open Euclid image. Perform WCS matching and look around.

Cutout a LOFAR image in a particular region of interest.

python3 cutout_2d.py IMAGES/image_full_ampphase_di_m.NS.int.restoredcorrectedflux.fits 268.728 65.804 6

Create contours and copy them over.

## SAMP

Use catalogue files and setup sending coordinates to DS9. Hop around some LOFAR sources.
Filter to some particular category (eg. z>5.0) and then send to DS9 to plot.

Demo the Euclid Q1 HIPS display which is suuuuper nice.
